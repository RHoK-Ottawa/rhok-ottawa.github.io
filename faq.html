              <p class="lead">What is a Hackathon?</p>
              <p>A hackathon is an event where people get together (usually over a weekend) to try and build a prototype to solve some problem defined by the event.</p>
              <p>At RHoK Ottawa, we are going to build open source software that solves hard problems facing humanity and humanitarians. For example, we are working with Amnesty to build a tablet app to help collect signatures.</p>
              <p class="lead">Do I have to be a "hacker" to participate?</p>
              <p>Not at all! Building great software requires designers, developers and people who are familiar with the problems we are solving, but most importantly we need people who are passionate about solving problems.</p>
              <p class="lead">Do I have to have a lot of experience?</p>
              <p>No! Hackathons are a great way to learn from people with more experience or to learn from people who have skills completely different from your own. If you are just getting started with CSS or want to know more about web pages we want you there</p>
              <p class="lead">What do I need to bring?</p>
              <p>We strongly recommend that you bring a laptop, since we are building software at the event, but it's not absolutely essential.</p>
              <p class="lead">What do you expect people to build in a weekend?</p>
              <p>To be very clear, it’s really hard to build something complete and working in a weekend. If at the end of the weekend, your team only has card board prototypes of an app flow, that’s perfectly ok! The whole point of a hackathon is to get people with different skill sets together to try and solve a problem.</p>
